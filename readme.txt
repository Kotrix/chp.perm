The function chp.perm() for a new, effective offline method for single change point detection in a linear time series regression model, 
called the residuals permutation-based method. 
The optimal changepoint in the method maximizes Cohenâ€™s effect size 
with the parameters estimated by the permutation of residuals in a linear model.
